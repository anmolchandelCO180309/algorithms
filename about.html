					<p>"It's located walking distance from the ski area and the main market, which is very convenient and still offers some good
					view and quiet. Rooms are decent. Their room heaters though need special recommendations as even with temperature as low
					as -5°, it was extremely effective so much so that one could sleep without any blanket. Very helpful staff, they even
					added a channel subscription on request"</p>
